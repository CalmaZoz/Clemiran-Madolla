#Banking System by CLemiran Madolla
I am a qualified Graphiic Designer from South Africa. I graduated 2020 at boston city campus and business college. 
The task I chose at The Sparks Foundation internship was web base banking system.
The website I created is mostly html which I did on notepad. This was my first website I am made so I recommend this book: HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites by Jon Duckett.
It's pretty straightforward and aid others just like me.
